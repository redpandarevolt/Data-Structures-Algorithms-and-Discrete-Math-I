# Data-Structures-Algorithms-and-Discrete-Math-I
This fast-paced course sequence (with CSS343) is intended to bring entering students' backgrounds up to a level where they can take Junior and Senior level CSS courses. By the end of this quarter, you will be familiar with much of the C++ language and the basics of object-oriented programming. You will understand how to analyze a problem and design a solution. You will know many basic data structures, algorithms, and the tradeoffs among memory, running time, and implementation time associated with them. Topics include: data abstraction, mathematical induction, propositions quantifiers, proofs, recursion, computational complexity and algorithm analysis, linked lists, stacks, queues, searching and sorting, and object-oriented methods.
